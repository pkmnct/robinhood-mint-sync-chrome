## Important Note: Mint now supports adding Robinhood accounts natively.
The extension should continue to work, but will add the Robinhood balance as a _collectible_. If you [add Robinhood to Mint natively](https://help.mint.com/General/888961131/How-do-I-add-a-new-account-in-Mint.htm) the balance will show up under investments. Any changes made to Robinhood or Mint in the future could break this extension.
